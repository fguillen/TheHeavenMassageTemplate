I had a rough day and felt in understanding sensitive hands. And in a safe place.

I had a rough day and came to the massage feeling quite stressed out. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with understanding and sensitivity. I felt like I was in a safe and nurturing environment, with hands that could sense my tension and work through it to leave me feeling relaxed and rejuvenated.

You did it with such ease, it felt very natural, that almost all the time I was simply lost. [...] I felt a very warm, almost hot spot in the middle of your hand. I have no explanation for this sensation, it was miraculous. Two days later, when I was cycling over some rough road, I felt with what ease my muscles in my body where shaken around. As if everything was loose.

Your massage was performed with such ease and naturalness that it felt as if I was truly being taken care of. I felt almost completely lost in the moment, experiencing a deep sense of relaxation. The sensation was truly amazing, I felt a warm and almost hot spot in the middle of your hand, something I couldn't explain, it was miraculous. The effects of the massage were evident even two days later, when I went cycling over some rough terrain, I was surprised by how easily my muscles were shaken around, as if everything was now more relaxed and loose.

I felt held by a human, I felt touched by flames and waves, and flamy waves, and wavy flames. I felt embraced and in peace. I felt really really safe. I felt that time was unimportant. I felt really held. That's all I can say for now. Thank you very much, Fernando

I felt as though I was being held and cared for by a human being in a way that was both comforting and invigorating. The sensation was like being touched by both flames and waves, an intense yet soothing experience. I felt embraced and at peace, safe and secure throughout the entire session. It was as if time didn't matter, I was completely lost in the moment, feeling held and nurtured. I cannot express enough how grateful I am for this experience, thank you Fernando.
