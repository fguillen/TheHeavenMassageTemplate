                                I had a feeling of full trust during this sensual and soothing massage.

                                the massage. I wanted that feeling to last forever. The truth is that you not only caressed my body, but also my soul. I
                                felt like dense energy was slowly dissipating. It was truly a magical moment and I would love to repeat it. You have a

                                my body was completely connected and whole, and this feeling has lasted until now. When I breathe, the air goes all the
                                way to my toes. The massage brought weakness and sadness up as well. Strength and happyness appeared after one day, are

                                The feeling of being held and nurtured throughout the experience was truly special. Thank you for this amazing

                                almost completely lost in the moment, experiencing a deep sense of relaxation. The sensation was truly amazing, I felt a
                                warm and almost hot spot in the middle of your hand, something I couldn't explain, it was miraculous. The effects of the

                                I really enjoyed the experience, the warm table and oils were amazing. I had a wonderful body sensation, it was a

                                tea. You were serene. I remember everything about the space, the smell, the light, and the temperature to be very cozy
                                and pleasant. I quickly relaxed. I remember the pressure of your hands, firm and fluid. I remember being present and
                                inside my body, something that I often forget. I felt calm, relaxed, secure, and lucky. I felt my body was very big.
