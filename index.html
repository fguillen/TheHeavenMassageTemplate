                                be and I followed the path of the encounter letting myself be surprised by destiny and accepting whatever was the offer.
                                I liked your energy and the cautious and loving way you guided everything. I had never received a lomi lomi massage and

                                <p>I remember the desire to arrive, leaving home happy, with the feeling of 'how lucky I am'. Arriving and finding the
                                garden full of vegetation with beautiful lighting, that also gave me the feeling that it was something special. You made
                                tea. You were serene. I remember everything about the space, the smell, the light, and the temperature to be very cozy
                                and pleasant. I quickly relaxed. I remember the pressure of your hands, firm and fluid. I remember being present and
                                inside my body, something that I often forget. I felt calm, relaxed, secure, and lucky. I felt my body was very big.
                                Then there was a lot of lightness, almost as if I were floating, like when nothing matters. I left floating and smiling.
