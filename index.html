                                The treatment is done with great care and at a comfortable pace. The touches range from gentle to intense and have put
                                me in a state of complete physical and mental relaxation.
                                I had a feeling of full trust during this sensual and soothing massage.

                                <p>I relaxed and disconnected my mind totally as if I were in meditation. This made the massage very intense both
                                physically and spiritually. I experienced it as an interesting mix of sensual and detox massage.

                                garden full of vegetation with beautiful lighting, that also gave me the feeling that it was something special. You made
                                tea. You were serene. I remember everything about the space, the smell, the light, and the temperature to be very cozy
                                and pleasant. I quickly relaxed. I remember the pressure of your hands, firm and fluid. I remember being present and
                                inside my body, something that I often forget. I felt calm, relaxed, secure, and lucky. I felt my body was very big.
                                Then there was a lot of lightness, almost as if I were floating, like when nothing matters. I left floating and smiling.
